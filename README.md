# EMS_Service
Employee Intake System

This is a Backend Spring boot application- which accepts the icoming employee Info in xml and stores in mysql DB.
Coming Soon : 
1- the incoming saved request stored in mysql Db would be converted to Json and stored in mongo DB, from where the EMS_app would show the employee data in UI.
2- SOAP Services is implemented and a other couple of rest calls would be integrated to validate the incoming employee data.
